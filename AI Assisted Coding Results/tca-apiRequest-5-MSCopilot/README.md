## Setup 
You need to Add The Composable Architecture as a dependency see [Getting Started](https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/gettingstarted)

## Prompts
MS Copilot

--------------------------- 
PROMPT

```
You will act as an expert Swift developer specializing in The Composable Architecture (TCA) pattern - https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture 

I need you to write Swift code for a SwiftUI feature using TCA that includes:
* A TextField where the user can input a topic.
* A Button that, when tapped, triggers an action to load questions related to the entered topic.
* A List that displays all the questions fetched from a mock API based on the topic.
* A Loading Spinner (ActivityIndicator) that appears while the questions are being fetched.
* If no questions are found, the list should appear empty.

Use The Composable Architecture (TCA) structure, ensuring that the code is:
* Modular, clean, and testable.
* Has a Swift UI View called 'TopicInputView' that has one text field to enter a topic, and one button to load questions using the text entered by the user.
* The State of the view should be maintained by a TopicInputFeature Reducer, which is a struct that contains the reducer logic, handles how actions modify the state, including setting loading state, handling results, and updating the view accordingly.
  * Within the TopicInputFeature struct
     * State: Holds the user's topic input, the loading state, the fetched questions, and a flag for handling empty results.
     * Action: Triggers for text input changes, button taps, starting the API call, receiving the API response, and finishing loading.
* The API call should be made by a TriviaAPIClient that can be used by the Reducer as a dependency

Ensure that:
* If the API call returns no questions, display an empty list with no error message.
* While the API call is in progress, show a loading spinner in place of the list.
* You provide comments to explain each part of the architecture.
* The code is concise, avoiding unnecessary complexity.
* Do not include unit tests in the code. Return the complete code as a single file that can be copied directly and run in an existing XCode project
