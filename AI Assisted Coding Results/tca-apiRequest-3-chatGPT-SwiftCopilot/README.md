Chat 3 - Swift Copilot - by Widenex

```

As a Principle iOS Engineer I want you to help me write functional Swift code that compiles.

Architecture Pattern: The Composable Architecture - https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture

Requirements: 
1. Create a Swift UI View that has one text field to enter a topic, and one button to load questions using the text entered by the user.

Assumptions: Assume I already have an XCode project created and that I have already imported The Composable Architecture dependency in my project

Output: Firstly Provide the Names and functions of the entities that will be needed to build the feature

---

Make the Reducer functionality be part of a struct or class?

---

modify the code above to move the QuestionState QuestionAction and QuestionEnvironment inside the QuestionFeature

---

Actually please take the Environment out of the QuestionFeature, and make it a separate struct called QuestionAPI

---

Now please provide the code in a single file containing the QuestionView, the QuestionFeature and the QuestionAPI

```

---- RESULT
-- Output
Multiple code blocks
Compiled Immediately? - Yes
Compiled after tweaks - Yes
Build Errors - 0
