Chat 2 - Swift Copilot - by Widenex

```
As a Principle iOS Engineer I want you to write functional Swift code that compiles.

Architecture Pattern: The Composable Architecture - https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture

Requirements: 
1. Create a Swift UI View called 'TopicInputView' that has one text field to enter a topic, and one button to load questions using the text entered by the user.
2. The State of the view should be maintained by a TopicInputFeature Reducer
3. The API call should be made by a TriviaAPIClient that can be used by the Reducer as a dependency

Assumptions: Assume I already have an XCode project created and that I have already imported The Composable Architecture dependency in my project

Output: Ensure that the code is output as a single file, and that the code will compile when copied into Xcode
```

---- RESULT

-- Output
Multiple code blocks
Compiled Immediately? - No
Compiled after tweaks - Yes
Build Errors - 6
- specified closure argument
- added missing argument to method invocation
